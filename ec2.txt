How to Connect to Linux Instance :

--> Select Instance, click on "Connect" --> "ec2 instance connect" --> "ec2-user" --> Connect. (We don't use this in realtime)
___

--> We can use windows Cmd prompt to connect to Linux Instance : Install "OpenSSH" in your laptop. 
	--> apps&features --> optional features --> openssh client--> Enable/Install.

==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse

==> ssh -i keypair.pem ec2-user@publicip/dns
ssh -i "linuxkp.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-108-53-198.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

__

Putty : Putty Don't support .pem format files.. Putty need .ppk (putty private key) file format. 
1 --> generate a .ppk file, before launching linux instance and use the .ppk file to connect using putty application.
2 --> Convert the existing .pem file to .ppk file using PuttyGEN application. 

https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html	--> Download putty

__

Install "GIT for Windows", Then use GIt terminal to connect. 

https://git-scm.com/download/win

--> go to the location where we have the keypair, "Git Bash here"


Bad Permissions error :  chmod 400 keypairname.pem  (Works with GIT for Windows)

How to deal with Volumes

root volume : COntains OS : gp2,gp3, io1, io2 and magnetic

IOPS : Input and output Operations per second

GP2, Gp3 : general Purpose :SSD: Suitable for most of the common workloads.
io1, io2 : Provisional IOPS :SSD: Gives best perf among all storage options. 
sc1 ($), st1($$) : HDD : wont support boot/root volume : Best throughput values. : log processing/bigdata
magnetic : standard : We dont use this.. : Cheapest storage 

Windows : FAT, NTFS and ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs

EBS : Elastic Bloc Storage : Block based storage : Designed to run OS.. 

root : SSD and magnetic is supported.
Addl volume : SSD, HDD and magnetic

Step 4 : CHoose Storage

--> EBS : Elastic Block Storage
SSD / HDD / Magnetic


root Volume : COntains OS : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 and standard/magnetic
Additional volume : all root supported + st1, sc1

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..

for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.

__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 

io2 Block Express volume : Min : 4 GiB, Max: 64 TiB...
Supports 256,000 IOPS.. 
__

Magnetic : Standard : Less freq accessed data, Low cost storage solutions.. 
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 1 TiB...
__

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : Bigdata, Data warehousing, log processing.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/S..

Cold HDD : sc1 : THroughput orientes storages, but with Less Frequently accessed.. Lower cost than st1.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/S..


Free Tier : 30 gb Gp2 and standard storage.. 

--> 20% of volume size (or) 5 gb.. WHichever is highest

** Need to perform OS level operations to make additional volumes available.
--> Disk Management --> diskmgmt.msc --> choose volume --> make it online --> Initilize disk --> SImple volume --> NTFS/FAT --> Create


Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs


grab the name of new volume : /dev/xvdb

lsblk		--> List block based devices
df -Th		--> List the available volumes

/dev/xvda1	--> root volume (/)
/dev/xvdf	--> new Volume name 

In windows OS, we mount new volumes to drive letters.. But in Linux OS, We mount volumes to Directory. 

mkdir newvolume

file -s /dev/xvdf  	--> If this command returns with "data", no file system.
			--> If this returns ext3/xfs filesystem.. We have a file system.


mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		--> Make file system and write it to Additonal volume

mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/	--> mount addl volume to directory


=================


--> Above mount is temp mount only.. it won't available after the instance reboot.
--> To make this volume perm mount to the directory, Add entry in "/etc/fstab" file.
--> Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" file. 

--> cat /etc/mtab		--> Grab the entry related to newly added addl volume

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0

--> vim /etc/fstab.. Write the above entry, save and quit the editor. (Do not edit the existing entry).

mount -all
__________
--> Increase the volume size the "Cosole" first, then execute the below command..!!

We can use "xfsprogs" to increase existing volume size. 

yum install xfsprogs

--> xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
--> xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume

--> Increasing volume is possible, But redusing volume is not possible.

===========================================================================


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, Add a 2 gb volume, associate it with ec2 instance.. Make 2 gb volume available at os level and write some data into it. (Reboot and verify)
df -Th after reboot, also should show 2gb volume.

Task 2 : Increase the size of 2gb volume to 4 gb and verify with df -Th. (personal Account)

Task 3 : Launch another ec2 instance in same AZ as existing ec2 instance.. Detach the volume from instance 1 and attach it to newly launched ec2 instance. You should be able to see all the data.
(personal Account)



=================================================

New volume name : xvdf	Full Path : /dev/xvdf

file -s /dev/xvdf
If output is ; Data, No file system
If output : XFS/EXT3.. There is a file system 

Command to write a file system :  mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

mkdir newvol

mount /dev/xvdf /newvol


lsblk
df -Th
file -s /dev/xvdf
mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
mkdir newvol
mount /dev/xvdf newvol/

File to add an entry, for perm mount : /etc/fstab
Get the entry information from : /etc/mtab

cat /etc/mtab ==> You will see latest entry related to the mount we performed. Get that emntry and write it to "/etc/fstab" file.


/dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/newvol xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0

vim /etc/fstab  ==> And add entry

=====

To extend existing volume.

step 1 : IN AWS Console, Increase the volume size
Step 2 : Run xfs_growfs -d "mountpoint"

ex: xfs_growfs -d "/home/ec2-user/newvol"
