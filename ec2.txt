How to Connect to Linux Instance :

--> Select Instance, click on "Connect" --> "ec2 instance connect" --> "ec2-user" --> Connect. (We don't use this in realtime)
___

--> We can use windows Cmd prompt to connect to Linux Instance : Install "OpenSSH" in your laptop. 
	--> apps&features --> optional features --> openssh client--> Enable/Install.

==> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse

==> ssh -i keypair.pem ec2-user@publicip/dns
ssh -i "linuxkp.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-108-53-198.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

__

Putty : Putty Don't support .pem format files.. Putty need .ppk (putty private key) file format. 
1 --> generate a .ppk file, before launching linux instance and use the .ppk file to connect using putty application.
2 --> Convert the existing .pem file to .ppk file using PuttyGEN application.

How to deal with Volumes

root volume : COntains OS : gp2,gp3, io1, io2 and magnetic

IOPS : Input and output Operations per second

GP2, Gp3 : general Purpose :SSD: Suitable for most of the common workloads.
io1, io2 : Provisional IOPS :SSD: Gives best perf among all storage options. 
sc1 ($), st1($$) : HDD : wont support boot/root volume : Best throughput values. : log processing/bigdata
magnetic : standard : We dont use this.. : Cheapest storage 

Windows : FAT, NTFS and ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs

EBS : Elastic Bloc Storage : Block based storage : Designed to run OS.. 

root : SSD and magnetic is supported.
Addl volume : SSD, HDD and magnetic

Step 4 : CHoose Storage

--> EBS : Elastic Block Storage
SSD / HDD / Magnetic


root Volume : COntains OS : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 and standard/magnetic
Additional volume : all root supported + st1, sc1

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..

for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.

__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 

io2 Block Express volume : Min : 4 GiB, Max: 64 TiB...
Supports 256,000 IOPS.. 
__

Magnetic : Standard : Less freq accessed data, Low cost storage solutions.. 
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 1 TiB...
__

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : Bigdata, Data warehousing, log processing.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/S..

Cold HDD : sc1 : THroughput orientes storages, but with Less Frequently accessed.. Lower cost than st1.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/S..


Free Tier : 30 gb Gp2 and standard storage.. 

--> 20% of volume size (or) 5 gb.. WHichever is highest

** Need to perform OS level operations to make additional volumes available.
--> Disk Management --> diskmgmt.msc --> choose volume --> make it online --> Initilize disk --> SImple volume --> NTFS/FAT --> Create


Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs


grab the name of new volume : /dev/xvdb

lsblk		--> List block based devices
df -Th		--> List the available volumes

/dev/xvda1	--> root volume (/)
/dev/xvdf	--> new Volume name 

In windows OS, we mount new volumes to drive letters.. But in Linux OS, We mount volumes to Directory. 

mkdir newvolume

file -s /dev/xvdf  	--> If this command returns with "data", no file system.
			--> If this returns ext3/xfs filesystem.. We have a file system.


mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		--> Make file system and write it to Additonal volume

mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/	--> mount addl volume to directory


=================


--> Above mount is temp mount only.. it won't available after the instance reboot.
--> To make this volume perm mount to the directory, Add entry in "/etc/fstab" file.
--> Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" file. 

--> cat /etc/mtab		--> Grab the entry related to newly added addl volume

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0

--> vim /etc/fstab.. Write the above entry, save and quit the editor. (Do not edit the existing entry).

mount -all
__________

--> Increase the volume size the "Cosole" first, then execute the below command..!!

We can use "xfsprogs" to increase existing volume size. 

yum install xfsprogs

--> xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
--> xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume

--> Increasing volume is possible, But redusing volume is not possible.

===========================================================================


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, Add a 2 gb volume, associate it with ec2 instance.. Make 2 gb volume available at os level and write some data into it. (Reboot and verify)
df -Th after reboot, also should show 2gb volume.

Task 2 : Increase the size of 2gb volume to 4 gb and verify with df -Th. (personal Account)

Task 3 : Launch another ec2 instance in same AZ as existing ec2 instance.. Detach the volume from instance 1 and attach it to newly launched ec2 instance. You should be able to see all the data.
(personal Account)

=================================================

New volume name : xvdf	Full Path : /dev/xvdf

file -s /dev/xvdf
If output is ; Data, No file system
If output : XFS/EXT3.. There is a file system 

Command to write a file system :  mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

mkdir newvol

mount /dev/xvdf /newvol


lsblk
df -Th
file -s /dev/xvdf
mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
mkdir newvol
mount /dev/xvdf newvol/

File to add an entry, for perm mount : /etc/fstab
Get the entry information from : /etc/mtab

cat /etc/mtab ==> You will see latest entry related to the mount we performed. Get that emntry and write it to "/etc/fstab" file.


/dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/newvol xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0

vim /etc/fstab  ==> And add entry

=====

To extend existing volume.

step 1 : IN AWS Console, Increase the volume size
Step 2 : Run xfs_growfs -d "mountpoint"

ex: xfs_growfs -d "/home/ec2-user/newvol"

============================================================================================


Instance 1 in ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in ap-south-1a ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2.. 

Instance 1 in ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in ap-south-1b ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2 is not possible as both are running in diff AZs.. 
Choose the volume --> Take a Snapshot --> Create a volume from snapshot, while creating choose ap-south-1b --> we'll get volume in 1b --> Attach to Instance 2 running in ap-south-1b

Instance 1 in Mumbai : ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in N Virginia : us-east-1a ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2 is not possible as both are running in diff regions.. 
Choose the volume --> Take a Snapshot --> Copy the snapshot to desired region (NV) 
--> Create a volume, while creating choose us-east-1a --> volume in 1a --> Attach to Instance 2 running in N Virginia : us-east-1a.
(Data transfer from region to region cost us)


Instance 1 in AWSACC1 : Mumbai : ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in AWSACC2 : Mumbai : ap-south-1a ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2 is not possible as both are running in diff aws accounts, regions..

** We cannot decrease the size of an EBS volume. Only increase is possible.
EBS VOlumes : Always use EBS volumes only.


Snapshot : Backup copy of an EBS volume.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/automating-amazon-ebs-snapshot-and-ami-management-using-amazon-dlm/


--> Snapshots are point-in-time copies.
--> Snapshots stores in S3 platform (Not in your s3).
--> Can we view what data we have inside snapshots..?? NO
--> Snapshot Works with Incremental backup mechanism.
--> If our volume is Encrypted, Snapshot also Encrypts automaticALLY. 
--> When we are launching/creating a volume from encrypted snapshot, volume also encrypts automatically.
--> We cannot share an Default Master key Encrypted snapshot.
--> If we are using Custom Managed encryption key, we can share snapshot with another aws account, but we need to provide permissions on encryption key also to another aws account.

______________________________________________________________________________________

SOP : Standard Operational Procedure :

==========================================================================================

D: 26/01/2024

--> CloudWatch : Service to monitor all AWS resources i.e; s3, ec2, rds.. 
--> We can monitor CPU, Disk and network for ec2 instance.
** With Default metrics, we cannot monitor MEMORY Utilisation. 
--> We can install an CloudWatch agenet and monitor Memory usage aswell. 


--> We have two types of monitorings in AWS.
==> Basic Monitoring : Free, Enabled by defaultly. 5 Minutes is monitoring interval.
==> Detailed Monitoring : COST US, Need to enable explicitlty, 1 minute is monitoring interval.

Vertical Scaling : Upgrading / Adding more resources to same Instance. i.e; from t2.micro to t3.medium

To perform vertical scaling in AWS, First stop the ec2 instance, then only we can upgrqade it.

echo "<h1>This is my Second webserver</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same instance resources.. t2.micro --> c5.2xlarge


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, while launching pass userdata and deliver webpage.

Task 2 : Create an alarm, when Instance CPU usage is less than 30% for 10 minutes, Stop the instance and get an alart to your email.

Task 3 (optional) : Install stress package on an ec2 instance, run this stress command for 10 min.. 
Now, create an Alarm to monitor your ec2 instance cpu, when cpu usage is 80% more for 5 min, Reboot your ec2 instance and get an alert to your email.


____________________________________________________________________________________


Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same instance resources.. t2.micro --> c5.2xlarge
Horizantal Scaling : Distribute application load to multiple ec2 instances.. 

Classic ELB : Layer 4/7 LB.. : Outdated.. : http, https, tcp, udp.. 
Application ELB : Layer 7 ELB.. : http and https
Network ELB : Layer 4 ELB.. : TCP, UDP, TLS 
Gateway ELB : GENEVE / 3rd party security virtual applicances.. 

**Please select at least two Subnets in different Availability Zones to provide higher availability for your load balancer.

** Dont use same Security group for your ec2 instance and Load balancer.

For ELBs, We will get DNS Endpoint.. Not an IP Address

If you want to view IP address of an ELB, 
--> Navigate to "Network interfaces" and observe, You can get IP of ELB.
--> nslookup "ELB-DNS-NAME"
___________________________________________________

Target Group : Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create each listener rule, you specify a target group and conditions. When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group.

Application ELB : http and https

Application Load balancing algorithm : 
--> Round robin
--> Least outstanding requests
--> Weighted ***

--> We cannot assign a dedicated IP address for our Application ELB.

Network ELB : TCP.. 
--> Flow Hash algorithm.
--> We CAN assign a dedicated IP address for our network ELB.

Application LB Supports path based routing, also supports Microservices.

NLB is capable to handle millions req/sec.

ELB Access Logs : Logging on ELB. Destination is s3.

ASG : Auto scaling group.

1. Create a GoldenAMI
2. create an ELB
3. Create ASG
	3.1 Create launch Template : GoldenAMI, Instancetype, Security Group, keypair
	3.2 Create scalings/asg : Manual scaling/ automatic scaling, ELB, Desired count..


ASG : Auto Scaling Group :

--> DYnamic (Step/Simple/TargetTracking) Load 
--> Scheduled scaling : 
--> Manual : 


ScaleIN : Remove the instance from ASG
ScaleOut : Add the instances to ASG.

How ASG will choose the instance to terminate if any ScaleIN action triggered..!! 

ASG Termination policy : refer to the image.


t2.micro --> Current configuration.. 
t2.nano..??? How you can do this with 0 downtime..!! 


Create a new launch configuration/template.. Associate this with ASG. Terminate the existing instance.. Now new instance will come with updated launch config settings.
(Set Desired capacity to 2)..!!! 


Task : 
Create an ASG with a V1 Launch tempplate.. Launch with Desired capacity as 2.. Test it.. 

Configure Alarm to set Desired capacity as 1, when cpu utilisation is =<10. 
--
Configure scheduled scaling to set DC as 3 instance at specific time and test it. 


Optional task : Try "stress" command to put load on ec2 instance and test high usage.

stress --cpu 1 --timeout 900
nproc --> cpu count

________

1 : Create a Golden AMI
2 : Create a ELB
3 : Create a Launch template
4 : Create an ASG with Fixed (2) and test it
5 : Confiure Scheduled scaling.
6 : Configure Simple scaling (low usage scaling)
7 : Configure Versions for Launch Tempplate. 


========================================================================

Task : Configure pipeline mechanism between ec2 instances and elb.
--> Edit your ec2 instance security group and open port 80 for ELB SG

--> When we give direct instance IP, it should not deliver any webpage.
--> When we give elb dns name, this should work.

Task 2 : Create a launch template with t2.micro
Create an ASG, Adjust Desired capacity manually and observe ec2 creation and terminations.

Task 3 : Create an ASG and try Simple Scaling, Step scaling with given script.

==> For windows OS we can use FSx, Works with SMB Protocol (Server message block)

_______________________________________________________________________________________

--> Create a security group and open NFS protocol. 
			--> Open for entire VPC IP address
			--> Open for ec2 instance private IP addresses
		** --> Open for ec2 instance Security group (pipeline mechanism)
		   --> As a last option, if no above option is working, open for Everyone.



Task : Create EFS and Mount it to multiple ec2 instances. Deliver Web Content to both the instances from EFS.


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, connect to it, Create EFS.. Install httpd in your ec2 instance.. Mount EFS to /var/www/html/ and create index.html...  make it as perm mount.
==> Now create a GOLDENAMI.. 
==> Configure ASG with this GOLDENAMI.. COnnect to any of the ec2 instance, modify the content.. this modification should reflect in all instance.. 

============================================================================================

Plecement Groups : 
--> Cluster PG : for group of ec2 instance, to get very very min latency, we can use this.
--> partition PG
--> Spread PG

Instance store volumes : We don't use this in real environments.   (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILTY)
	--> Also called as Ephemeral storages (Temporary storage).
	--> We cannot STOP/Start the instance.
	--> Storage will be delivered from underlying host/physical resources.
	--> If required, we can reboot. We don't loss any data.
	--> If underlying h/w failure happens, we'll loss all the data.

Dedicated and Shared tenancy :
--> Shared tenancy : underlying hardware shared with multiple customers.
--> Dedicated tenancy:
	--> Dedicated instance : Dedicated instance provided by aws. No control on backend process.
	--> Dedicated host : We can apply licenses at underlying physical resources. Also, we can launch multiple instances on a dedicated host.
